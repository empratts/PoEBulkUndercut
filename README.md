# PoE Bulk Undercut

PoE Bulk Undercut is a browser extension that interacts with the official Path of Exile bulk trade website. It provides a button on each search result that reads the contents of the clipboard and, if it contains the description of the item (obtained from hovering the item in game and pressing Ctrl-C) for sale in that result, replaces it with the text needed to price the stack of items such that it will appear above the listing on the trade site.

## Workflow

- Use a trade tool to open a search for the item with a minimum stock set (or do it manually)
  - Ensure that the tool leaves the item description on the clipboard
- Choose the listing that you want to undercut
- Right Click on the item in-game (assuming it is in a public tab)
- Paste
- Press Enter
